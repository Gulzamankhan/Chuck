# Chuck

A game I built to teach myself Swift & about the iOS environment. Feedback on code & bugs would be very much welcome!

Click here to [download & play the game](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chuck/id1050453297).

## Rules

Flick the ball around the screen with your finger and catch it. It must hit all sides.
You can tilt the screen to adjust the flight of the ball.

The game is over if you miss a catch or you catch the ball without it having hit all the sides.
